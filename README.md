# AI-PyShorts
One-liner AI utilities for text, images &amp; data ⚡️.

This repo contains short, practical AI scripts built on Hugging Face Transformers 🤗 and PyTorch 🔥.

Focus is on ready-to-use one-liners for tasks like:

- 📝 Text summarization
- 😊 Sentiment analysis
- 🖼️ Image caption generation

The goal is to make AI utilities simple, fast, and reusable — minimal code, instant results.

(Detailed usage steps and more scripts will be added as the repo grows.)
